Hello, I am currently a third-year graduated student pursuing a master’s degree. I have a passion for exploration, as I believe it is the driving force behind progress. I possess a strong sense of initiative and am not afraid to try new things. My research interests are **Multimodal Data**, **Anomaly Detection**, **Graph Neural Networks**, and **Smart Contract Vulnerability Detection**. I am currently striving to pursue these passions and hope to have the opportunity to explore interesting and meaningful things with you.
